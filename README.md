Wherro simplifies the location syncing to the server.

Apps using Wherro will run 2 services responsible for Location Syncing

## Getting Started 👣

Wherro is distributed through [Bintray](https://bintray.com/deeptolat/LocationSyncService/com.shuttl.locations_sync). To use it you need to add the following **Gradle dependency** to your `build.gradle` file of your android app module (NOT the root file).

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation(group: 'com.shuttl', name: 'locationsyncservice', version: '0.14', ext: 'aar', classifier: '')
}
```

To start using Wherro, just put in `LocationConfigs` through `LocationsHelper.initLocationsModule` method:

```kotlin
LocationsHelper.initLocationsModule(app = application, locationConfigs = LocationConfigs())
```

```kotlin
LocationConfigs(val minTimeInterval: Int = 10000, // min Time Interval for Location Fetching  
  val minDistanceInterval: Int = 100, // min Distance Interval for Location Fetching  
  val minSyncInterval: Int = 10000, // min Time Interval for Location Syncing  
  val xApiKey: String? = "", // xApiKey Auth Key for the URL to function  
  val syncUrl: String? = "" // PUTS the location parameters on this URL  
  )
```

**That's it!** 🎉 Wherro will now start 2 services corresponding to Location Saving and Location Syncing simultaneously and show 1 notification for the same
